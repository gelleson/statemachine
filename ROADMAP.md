## **Roadmap for `statemachine` Project**

### **Milestone 1: Core Functionality**
- **Goal**: Build the foundation of the state machine with essential features.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement basic state machine structure with states and transitions. âœ…
  - Add event handling mechanism for state transitions. âœ…
  - Implement guards for conditional transitions. âœ…
  - Add concurrency-safe state updates using mutex. âœ…
  - Write unit tests for core functionality. âœ…

---

### **Milestone 2: Advanced Features**
- **Goal**: Enhance the state machine with more advanced capabilities.
- **Tasks**:
  - Add support for dynamic state transitions using middleware (`Pipe`). âœ…
  - Implement orphan transition detection and reporting (`FindOrphanTransitions`). âœ…
  - Add DOT graph generation for visualizing the state machine (`GenerateDOT`). âœ…
  - Implement error handling for invalid transitions and missing handlers. âœ…
  - Add support for resetting the state machine to the initial state. âœ…
  - Write unit tests for advanced features. âœ…

---

### **Milestone 3: Developer Experience**
- **Goal**: Improve usability, documentation, and developer tools.
- **Tasks**:
  - Add comprehensive GoDoc comments for all public APIs. ðŸš§
  - Create detailed example usage documentation (`basic_usage.go`). âœ…
  - Add verbose logging for debugging state transitions and handler execution. ðŸš§
  - Implement a CLI tool for generating DOT graphs from state machine definitions. ðŸš§
  - Write a README with installation instructions, examples, and contribution guidelines. ðŸš§

---

### **Milestone 4: Performance Optimization**
- **Goal**: Optimize the state machine for performance and scalability.
- **Tasks**:
  - Benchmark state transitions under high concurrency. ðŸš§
  - Optimize transition rule lookup with a more efficient data structure. ðŸš§
  - Add support for event batching to reduce overhead in high-frequency scenarios. ðŸš§
  - Profile and optimize memory usage. ðŸš§

---

### **Milestone 5: Extensibility and Integrations**
- **Goal**: Make the state machine more extensible and integrate with other systems.
- **Tasks**:
  - Add support for plugins or custom hooks (e.g., pre/post-transition hooks). ðŸš§
  - Integrate with popular Go frameworks (e.g., Gin, Echo). ðŸš§
  - Add support for distributed state machines (e.g., using Redis or etcd for state storage). ðŸš§
  - Implement a REST API for remote state machine control. ðŸš§

---

### **Milestone 6: Community and Ecosystem**
- **Goal**: Build a community around the project and foster ecosystem growth.
- **Tasks**:
  - Publish the package to `pkg.go.dev` and other package repositories. ðŸš§
  - Write blog posts or tutorials to showcase use cases. ðŸš§
  - Create a GitHub repository with issues, discussions, and contribution guidelines. âœ…
  - Encourage community contributions by labeling issues (e.g., `good-first-issue`, `help-wanted`). ðŸš§

---

## **Future Ideas**
- Add support for hierarchical state machines (nested states).
- Implement time-based transitions (e.g., timeouts).
- Add support for event replay and state machine snapshots.
- Build a web-based UI for visualizing and editing state machines.
